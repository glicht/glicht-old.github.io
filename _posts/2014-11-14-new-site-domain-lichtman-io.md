I am happy to announce that this blog and personal website is now available at the following domain name: [lichtman.io](http://lichtman.io). I must say that setup was super simple. Basically all I had to do is configure the DNS of the domain and add a CNAME file in my github repository. Nice job by the GitHub team for keeping things simple.
